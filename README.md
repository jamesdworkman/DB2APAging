Creates an AP Aging from a DB2 database with multiple companies and puts it into a report with these columns:
"Not Due","Due this week","1-7 Days Past Due","8-14 Days Past Due","15-21 Days Past Due","3+ Weeks Past Due"
The column values and calculations can be adjusted to whatever your company finds most useful
